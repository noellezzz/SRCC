            <p>The students, faculty and community of SEN. RENATO “COMPAÑERO” CAYETANO MEMORIAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY HIGH SCHOOL take pride in our school as the only Science and Technology High School in Taguig and Pateros.</p>
            <p>With the strong commitment of Congressman ALAN PETER S. CAYETANO to provide the district of Taguig and Pateros (TAPAT) with the opportunity to a free and quality science and technology education among the poor and deserving students from the public school system with the facilities and curriculum that can compete with exclusive private schools in Metro Manila, House Bill No. 4448 was introduced on February 21, 2002. It is an act establishing a Science and Technology High School in Pamayanang Diego Silang in Taguig City to be known as the TAGUIG-PATEROS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY HIGH SCHOOL and the funds were appropriated for its establishment.</p>
            <p>On September 4, 2002 a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was signed between Congressman Cayetano, Rufo B. Colayco of Bases Conversion Development Authority and Jovita O. Calixihan of DepEd-Division of Taguig-Pateros for the allocation of a five thousand (5,000) square meter area of the community facilities at the heart of Pamayanang Diego Silang in Taguig.</p>
            <p>The site was immediately equipped with perimeter fence through the efforts of the late Sen. Renato “Compañero” Cayetano. Immediately, a four-storey, twelve class room building was built and the school was ready for occupancy. In early 2003, Congressman Cayetano’s political will to produce a show window on the division paved the way for another four-storey twelve classroom building in preparation for its opening.</p>
            <p>The Division Office of DepEd Taguig-Pateros played its part in this endeavor by preparing and complying with all the requirements under DepEd Order No. 71 s.2003 through Mr. George P. Tizon, the Administrative Officer of the Division. On September 21, 2004, the approval for the establishment of SRCCMTHS was granted by the DepEd-National Capital Region after having complied and met the standard of a science & technology school.</p>
            <p>On December 14, 2004, Dr. Rolando L. Magno, Schools Division Superintendent of Taguig & Pateros announced the administration of entrance examination for admission among graduating students of public schools. More than three hundred (300) students took the exam and only 146 passed after a series of battery test.</p>
            <p>At the end of school year 2004-2005, a bill was introduced by Congressman Edmund Reyes, the Chairman of Committee on Education in the House of Representatives renaming Taguig-Pateros Science & Technology High School to be SEN. RENATO “COMPAÑERO” CAYETANO MEMORIAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY HIGH SCHOOL (SRCCMSTHS).</p>
            <p>Hence, on June 6, 2005 “SRCC” as our students call it, began its operation in providing quality education with emphasis on science & technology, mathematics and communication arts among deserving students of Taguig City and the Municipality of Pateros under the able leadership of its OIC/Principal, GEORGE P. TIZON, the concurrent Administrative Officer V of DepEd-Taguig City & Pateros.</p>
            <p>The school took off and bent on soaring high to emulate its primary model of success, an ordinary public school student who became one of the greatest senators of the republic, the late Sen. RENATO “COMPAÑERO” CAYETANO. Indeed our students are proud to be labeled “Compañeros” and “Compañeras” of the Division of Taguig City and Pateros.</p>
